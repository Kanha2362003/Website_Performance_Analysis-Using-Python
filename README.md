# Website_Performance_Analysis-Using-Python
The project focuses on analyzing a website‚Äôs performance by examining key user engagement and traffic metrics. Using Python powerful data analysis and visualization libraries, the project helps uncover insights about how visitors interact with the site, how different traffic channels perform, and where improvements can be made to boost engagement.
‚úÖ Key Objectives
Collect and clean website session data.

Analyze total sessions, engaged sessions, and non-engaged sessions.

Identify which traffic channels (e.g., Organic Search, Direct, Referral, Social) drive the most and least engagement.

Visualize performance metrics clearly to support decision-making.

Generate actionable recommendations to improve website performance.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
Python: Data manipulation and analysis.

Pandas: Data cleaning, aggregation, and transformation.

Seaborn & Matplotlib: Data visualization.

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data exploration (optional).


üß© Core Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Import & Cleaning

Load the dataset (CSV/Excel).

Inspect for missing or inconsistent values.

Prepare clean DataFrames for analysis.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Aggregation

Group data by Channel_Group.

Calculate total sessions and engaged sessions.

Derive non-engaged sessions as the difference.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Transformation

Reshape the data (using melt) for easy plotting.

Prepare summary tables for reporting.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization

Create bar plots to compare engaged vs. non-engaged sessions by traffic source.

Use pie charts, stacked bar plots, or trend lines if time series data is available.

Highlight top and bottom performing channels.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Insights & Recommendations

Identify which channels bring high-quality traffic.

Spot channels with high bounce or low engagement.

Suggest optimizations (e.g., invest more in Organic, improve Referral quality, optimize Paid Ads).

üîë Key Learning Outcomes
Hands-on experience with real-world web analytics data.

Proficiency in data wrangling and aggregation using Pandas.

Practical skills in designing clear, actionable visualizations.

Ability to turn raw data into business insights.
